Plan for Breakout game, CS308 Spring 2018
by Siyuan Chen sc456

Interesting variant: Pinball Breakout
	Pinball Breakout is interesting in that it combines two games perfectly. It also makes the original
Breakout more fun and more complicated to control since the player could now control the two "flippers" 
in addition to the paddle. The existence of "targets" and "bumpers" allows the player to obtain more points 
thus making the game more competitive.

Types of blocks:
1. Glass: most simple block that disappears after one hit.
2. Wooden: disappears after two hits; may generate Power-ups
3. Stone: disappears after three hits; may generate Power-ups
4. Iron: this kind of blocks could never be broken
5. Bomb: red blocks that are intended to be hit lastly; hitting them will generate a "debuff" to make 
the paddle smaller or the bouncer much faster

Types of Power-ups: 
1. A: make the paddle longer
2. B: give the paddle the power to warp from one side to the other when it reaches the edge
3. C: make the paddle "sticky": i.e. the bouncer sticks to the bouncer for some time before it bounces off
4. D: give the bouncer the power to destroy "iron" blocks
5. E: additional life

Cheat keys:
1. D: destroy all "iron" blocks
2. R: reset the bouncer and paddle to its starting position
3. L: give an additional life to the player
4. 1-3: jump to lvl 1-3
5. F: makes the bouncer faster

Stages of the game:
1. Start screen
	As its name suggests, the screen has a Start button that allows the user to start the game. The player
also enters his/her name to participate in the Leaderboard before starting the game.
2. Lvl 1
	A most simple version of block configurations; all blocks are glass blocks in an m*n matrix that is 
located relatively far from the paddle. (no power-ups on this level)
3. Lvl 2
	Iron and Bomb blocks are added; Wooden and Stone blocks appear;
	The blocks are located closer to the paddle; two layers (rows) of iron blocks separates different
neighborhood of blocks. A sketch of the configuration looks like the following when - represents a non-iron
block and * represents an iron block: (final details of design may vary)

4. Lvl 3
	A column of iron blocks is added; the blocks are even closer to the paddle.

5. End screen
	The End screen displays the score of the player; has a Restart button to restart the game and 
a Leaderboard button to display the Leaderboard.
6. Failure screen
	The failure screen just says that player failed and kindly asks if the player wants to play again. As
for scores, well, scores are not awarded to losers :<
	
Extra feature: 
1. Score system and Leaderboard:
	Scores are awarded both for breaking blocks and time used to complete the game. (iron blocks award a lot
of points if the player has used the iron-breaker Power-up)
	Leaderboard shows the recent top 5 highest scores and the player obtaining that score.
	
Reason: The addition of the Leaderboard would allow friends to compete in playing the game; it also grants the 
player a motivation to challenge the game again after completing it.

2.	Pinball elements
	Addition of two flippers that on two edges of the scene that could rotate around a pivot and change the 
bouncer's direction (just like those in Pinball) and several targets that if hit, could award points to 
the player.

Reason: Just like discussed above, adding the two flippers could make the game more fun as the controls are 
more complicated.
